# What do you mean by ORM? Explain.


# ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping. It is a technique used in software development to map data between a relational database
# and an object-oriented programming language. The basic idea behind ORM is to create a virtual object database 
# that can be used in the application code, and to map this object database to a real database. 
# This allows developers to work with the database in terms of objects and classes, rather than in terms of tables and rows.

# In an ORM, each table in a relational database is represented by a class, and each row in the table is represented by an instance of that class. 
# The columns in the table are represented by the attributes of the class. 
# The ORM provides methods for performing database operations on the objects, such as creating, updating, and deleting records.

# ORMs provide several advantages over traditional SQL-based database access:

# Improved code organization: 
# By mapping database tables to classes, the code becomes more organized and easier to maintain.

# Portability: 
# Since the ORM abstracts the database operations, 
# the application code can be made more portable between different database systems.

# Security: 
# ORMs can help prevent SQL injection attacks by automatically escaping and quoting input values.

# Productivity: 
# ORMs can greatly reduce the amount of code needed to perform common database operations, 
# which can save developers a lot of time.

# However, 
# there are also some disadvantages to using an ORM, such as the potential 
# for performance overhead due to the additional layers of abstraction, and the difficulty 
# of mapping complex database schemas to object-oriented models.

# Overall, ORMs are a powerful tool for simplifying database access in object-oriented applications, 
# but they should be used carefully and with an understanding of their strengths and weaknesses.
