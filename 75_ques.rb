# What is your approach to write a thin controller? Also explain why a controller should be thin and what are the advantages of it?

# Writing a "thin" controller is a best practice in Rails and other web application frameworks. 

# A thin controller means that the controller's primary responsibility is to manage the flow of requests and responses, 
# handling the interaction between the model and the view. The business logic and heavy lifting, on the other hand, 
# should be delegated to other components such as models, service objects, or other specialized classes.

# Here are some approaches and reasons for keeping controllers thin:

# Approaches to Write a Thin Controller:

# Delegate to Models:
# Move business logic and data manipulation tasks to the corresponding model classes.
# Models encapsulate the data layer and are responsible for handling database interactions and business rules.

# Thin controller
def create
  @user = User.new(user_params)

  if @user.save
    redirect_to @user
  else
    render 'new'
  end
end

# Thin model
class User < ApplicationRecord
  validates :name, presence: true
  # ...
end

# Use Service Objects:
# Extract complex business logic into service objects, especially when an operation involves multiple models or non-trivial processing.
# Service objects encapsulate a specific piece of business logic, making the code more modular.

# Thin controller
def create
  result = UserCreationService.new(user_params).perform

  if result.success?
    redirect_to result.user
  else
    render 'new'
  end
end

# Service object
class UserCreationService
  def initialize(params)
    @params = params
  end

  def perform
    # Business logic for creating a user
  end
end

# Advantages of a Thin Controller:

# Readability:
# Thin controllers are more readable and maintainable because they focus on the high-level orchestration of the request-response cycle.
# Business logic is placed in appropriate components, making it easier to understand and reason about.

# Testability:
# Thin controllers are easier to test as they primarily involve handling HTTP requests and responses.
# Business logic can be tested separately in models or service objects, promoting more focused and targeted tests.

# Reusability:
# Business logic placed in models or service objects can be reused across different controllers and parts of the application.
# Code reusability leads to a more modular and scalable codebase.

# Flexibility:
# Separating concerns allows for greater flexibility when modifying or extending functionality.
# Changes to business logic can be made without impacting the overall structure of the controller.

# Maintenance:
# A thin controller is easier to maintain because each component has a clear and well-defined responsibility.
# Changes to business rules or data manipulation can be localized to models or service objects, reducing the risk of unintended consequences.

# Adherence to MVC Principles:
# Thin controllers align with the principles of Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture by ensuring that controllers focus on coordinating 
# the flow of data and interactions.

# In summary, writing a thin controller in Rails improves code organization, readability, testability, and maintainability. 
# It follows best practices in software design and ensures that each component of the application has a clear and defined responsibility, 
# to a more robust and scalable codebase.
