# send() and public_send() 

# In Ruby, including Rails, send and public_send are methods that allow you to dynamically invoke methods on an object. 
# They are commonly used in metaprogramming scenarios and are part of Ruby's reflection capabilities.

#-> send Method:
# The send method is a versatile method that can be used to invoke any method on an object, including private methods. 
# It takes the method name as its first argument and any arguments to pass to the method as subsequent arguments.

class MyClass
    def greeting(name)
      "Hello, #{name}!"
    end
  end
  
  obj = MyClass.new
  result = obj.send(:greeting, "John")
  puts result
  # Output: Hello, John!
  # In this example, send is used to dynamically invoke the greeting method on the obj object.
  
  #-> public_send Method:
  # The public_send method is similar to send, but it restricts the invocation to public methods.
  # If you try to invoke a private or protected method using public_send, it will raise an exception.
  
  class MyClass
    private
  
    def private_greeting(name)
      "Private hello, #{name}!"
    end
  end
  
  obj = MyClass.new
  
  # This will raise a NoMethodError because private methods cannot be called with public_send
  result = obj.public_send(:private_greeting, "John")
  
  
  
  
  #->  Example Use Case in Rails Controllers:
  # In Rails controllers, send and public_send can be used to dynamically invoke actions based on parameters or conditions.
  
  class MyController < ApplicationController
    def action_one
      # ...
    end
  
    def action_two
      # ...
    end
  
    def dynamic_action
      action_name = params[:action_name]
      if respond_to?(action_name) && action_name.start_with?('action_')
        send(action_name)
      else
        render plain: 'Invalid action', status: :bad_request
      end
    end
  end
  
  # In this example, the dynamic_action method uses send to dynamically invoke an action based on the value of the action_name parameter.
  # While send and public_send can be powerful tools, it's important to use them with care and consider alternative approaches 
  # if they make the code overly complex or less maintainable.
