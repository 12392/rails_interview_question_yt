# How do you organize your controllers? Tell me about the way that you can make a controller thin

# Organizing controllers in a Rails application is an important aspect of code maintainability and scalability. 
# One common approach is to group related actions or resources into a single controller. 
# For example, if you have a blog application, you may have a PostsController to handle CRUD operations 
# for posts and a CommentsController to handle CRUD operations for comments.

# To make a controller thin, we need to keep the controller focused on its main responsibility,
# which is to handle HTTP requests and responses. This means that the controller should contain as little business logic as possible and
# delegate that responsibility to other parts of the application, such as models, services, or libraries.

# Here are some ways to make a controller thin:

# Use strong parameters to sanitize and validate input data.

# Move business logic into models, services, or other classes. 
# For example, if a controller action needs to perform a complex query or update multiple records,
#  we can move that logic into a service object and call it from the controller.

# Use view models to prepare data for rendering. Instead of including logic 
# for formatting or filtering data in the controller or view, we can create a separate view model to encapsulate that responsibility.

# Use partials to share view code between controllers or actions. 
# This can help reduce duplication and keep the code DRY.

# Use before and after filters to encapsulate common behavior. 
# For example, if several actions in a controller require authentication, we can use a 
# before filter to check that the user is logged in.

# Overall, keeping controllers thin can make them easier to understand, maintain, and test. 
# It also promotes separation of concerns and can lead to a more modular and flexible architecture.
