# What do you mean by asset pipeline?

# The asset pipeline is a feature in Ruby on Rails that provides a way to manage and organize the various static assets (e.g., JavaScript, CSS, images, fonts) used by an application. 
# The asset pipeline is responsible for compiling and compressing these assets, and for serving them efficiently to the client.

# The asset pipeline has several key features:

# Concatenation: The asset pipeline concatenates multiple asset files into a single file, 
# reducing the number of HTTP requests required to load the assets.

# Minification: The asset pipeline compresses the size of the asset files, 
# making them smaller and faster to download.

# Preprocessing: The asset pipeline allows for preprocessing of assets using tools such as Sass, CoffeeScript, or ERB, 
# which can simplify the development process and improve maintainability.

# Caching: The asset pipeline can cache assets in the client's browser or on the server, 
# reducing the need to download the assets on subsequent requests.

# Digests: The asset pipeline adds a digest (a unique identifier) to the filename of each asset, 
# which ensures that clients always receive the latest version of the asset and avoids issues with browser caching.

# Overall, the asset pipeline helps to streamline the management and delivery of static assets in a Ruby on Rails application, 
# improving performance and reducing complexity.
