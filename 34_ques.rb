# What do you mean by API versioning in Rails? Explain when there is a need to change the version of an API?


# API versioning in Ruby on Rails refers to the practice of managing different versions of an 
# API that may have different sets of features or behavior. This is typically done to ensure that changes to the 
# API do not break existing clients, and to provide a stable interface for clients that rely on a specific version of the API.

# In Rails, there are several ways to implement API versioning, including using namespaces,
# MIME types, custom request headers, or query parameters. 
# the specific approach used may depend on the requirements of the API and the needs of the clients.
    
# There are several reasons why you might need to change the version of an API:
    
# Adding new features: If you want to add new functionality to your API, 
# you may need to introduce a new version to ensure that existing clients are not affected by the changes.
    
# Changing existing behavior: If you need to change the behavior of existing API endpoints, 
# you may need to create a new version to avoid breaking existing clients.
    
# Removing or deprecating functionality: If you need to remove or deprecate existing functionality in your API, 
# you may need to create a new version to allow clients to transition to the new API without disruption.
    
# Fixing bugs or security issues: If you need to fix bugs or security issues in your API, 
# you may need to create a new version to ensure that clients are using a secure and reliable interface.
    
# In general, it is a good practice to create a new version of your API whenever you make changes that could potentially 
# break existing clients. By using versioning, you can provide a stable and predictable interface for clients, and ensure 
# that changes to the API are introduced in a controlled and backwards-compatible manner.
