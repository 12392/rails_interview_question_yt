# What is the difference between dependent: :destroy and dependent: :delete_all?

# In Ruby on Rails, the dependent option is used in associations to specify the behavior of associated records when the parent record is destroyed. 
# Two common values for the dependent option are :destroy and :delete_all. Here's the difference between them:

# dependent: :destroy
# When you set dependent: :destroy, it means that when the parent record is destroyed, 
# Rails will go through each associated record and call their destroy method. 
# This invokes ActiveRecord callbacks (such as before_destroy and after_destroy) on the associated records. 
# If an associated record has any dependent associations with dependent: :destroy set, the process will continue recursively.

# Example:

class Author < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :books, dependent: :destroy
end

# If you destroy an author, all associated books will have their destroy method called, triggering callbacks and cascading the deletion.

# dependent: :delete_all
# When you set dependent: :delete_all, it means that when the parent record is destroyed, 
# Rails will issue a single SQL DELETE statement for all associated records. This bypasses ActiveRecord callbacks, 
# and the associated records are deleted directly from the database without invoking any model-level logic or callbacks.

# Example:

class Author < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :books, dependent: :delete_all
end

# If you destroy an author, all associated books will be deleted with a single SQL statement, 
# without invoking the destroy method or any associated callbacks on the Book model.

# Considerations:
# Callbacks and Business Logic:

# Use dependent: :destroy if you want to trigger model callbacks and execute additional business logic when destroying associated records.
# Use dependent: :delete_all if you want a more performant deletion without triggering model callbacks.

# Performance:
# dependent: :delete_all is generally more performant since it results in a single SQL statement to delete all associated records.

# Consistency:
# If you have business logic or validations in your models that should be consistently applied, dependent: :destroy might be more suitable.
# Choose between dependent: :destroy and dependent: :delete_all based on your specific requirements and whether you need to execute model callbacks 
# or prefer a more straightforward database-level deletion
