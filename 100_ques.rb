# In what cases the change method is not reversible in a Rails migration?
# In Rails migrations, the `change` method is a convenient way to define migrations without explicitly specifying separate `up` and `down` methods. The `change` method is automatically reversible, allowing Rails to infer how to reverse the migration based on the operations performed in the `change` block.

# However, there are cases where the `change` method is not reversible automatically. Some common scenarios include:

# 1. **Irreversible Operations:**
#    - If a migration involves operations that cannot be automatically reversed, such as dropping a column or executing custom SQL that is not reversible, the `change` method may not be reversible. For example:

     ruby
     class IrreversibleMigration < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.0]
       def change
         # This operation cannot be automatically reversed
         remove_column :table_name, :column_name
       end
     end
     

#      In such cases, you need to manually define the `up` and `down` methods to handle the reversal of the operation.

# 2. **Custom Logic:**
#    - If the migration involves complex custom logic or external dependencies that cannot be automatically inferred for reversal, it might not be reversible. For example:

     ruby
     class CustomLogicMigration < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.0]
       def change
         # Custom logic that cannot be automatically reversed
         execute "UPDATE table_name SET column_name = 'new_value' WHERE condition"
       end
     end
     

#      Again, you would need to manually define the `up` and `down` methods to handle the reversal.

# 3. **Changes Outside ActiveRecord:**
#    - If the migration involves changes that go beyond ActiveRecord's capabilities, such as modifications to external services, file system operations, etc., the `change` method may not be reversible. You would need to manually implement the reversal logic in the `down` method.

# In cases where the `change` method is not reversible, it's important to provide explicit instructions in the `down` method on how to reverse the migration. This ensures that the migration can be safely rolled back, especially in scenarios where 
# it is necessary to undo changes made to the database schema or data.
