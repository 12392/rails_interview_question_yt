# How many template engines are supported by Rails? Which one is your preference and why?

# Rails supports multiple template engines, allowing developers to choose the one that best fits their preferences and requirements. 
# Some of the commonly used template engines in Rails include:

# ERB (Embedded Ruby): 
# This is the default template engine in Rails. It allows you to embed Ruby code directly into HTML, 
# providing a seamless integration of logic and presentation.

# Haml: Haml is a concise and indentation-based template engine. It uses a clean syntax that reduces the amount of boilerplate code. 
# Haml is often chosen for its brevity and readability.

# Slim: Slim is another indentation-based template engine similar to Haml. It aims to be more readable and concise than ERB, 
# and it allows for a clean and elegant markup.

# Liquid: Liquid is a templating engine that is often used for dynamic content within static pages. 
# It is designed to be safe to use by non-developers, making it suitable for scenarios where user-generated content needs to be rendered.

# Mustache: Mustache is a logic-less template engine that enforces separation of concerns. 
# It provides a simple and extensible syntax for templates and is often used in scenarios where templates need to be 
# shared between different programming languages.

# I don't have personal preferences. However, the choice of a template engine is often subjective and depends 
# on factors such as personal preference, team familiarity, project requirements, and specific use cases.

# ERB: It's the default and widely used template engine in Rails. Its familiarity and seamless integration with 
# Ruby code make it a solid choice for many projects.
