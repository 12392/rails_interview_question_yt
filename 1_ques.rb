# What is the difference between has many :through and has_and_belongs_to_many? 
# Also state which one is better?



# Both has_many :through and has_and_belongs_to_many are association types in Ruby on Rails for defining a many-to-many relationship between two models. 
# However, they differ in how they handle the join table.

# has_and_belongs_to_many creates a simple join table with two columns, 
# each containing a foreign key to one of the associated models. 
# This association is generally used when you do not need to store any additional data about the relationship between the models.

# has_many :through creates a separate model, often called a join model, that represents the relationship between the two associated models. 
# This join model can have additional attributes and behavior, such as timestamps or validation rules. 
# The has_many :through association is generally used when you need to store additional data about the relationship between the models.

# In terms of which one is better, it really depends on the specific requirements of your application. 
# If you only need a simple many-to-many relationship without any additional data, then has_and_belongs_to_many may be a good choice. 
# However, if you need to store additional data or behavior related to the relationship, then has_many :through is the better choice.

# In addition, has_many :through allows for more flexibility in querying the relationship, 
# as you can access the join model directly and perform additional queries on it. 
# However, this additional flexibility comes at the cost of additional complexity and a potentially larger codebase.




# Here is an example of has_and_belongs_to_many association:

class User < ApplicationRecord
    has_and_belongs_to_many :roles
  end
  
  class Role < ApplicationRecord
    has_and_belongs_to_many :users
  end
end



# This creates a roles_users table with two foreign keys: role_id and user_id.

# has_many :through creates a separate model, often called a join model, 
# that represents the relationship between the two associated models. 
# This join model can have additional attributes and behavior, such as timestamps or validation rules. 
# The has_many :through association is generally used when you need to store additional data about the relationship between the models.

# Here is an example of has_many :through association:


class User < ApplicationRecord
    has_many :user_roles
    has_many :roles, through: :user_roles
  end
  
  class UserRole < ApplicationRecord
    belongs_to :user
    belongs_to :role
  end
  
  class Role < ApplicationRecord
    has_many :user_roles
    has_many :users, through: :user_roles
  end
  


#   This creates a user_roles join model that has foreign keys to both users and roles. 
#   This join model can also have additional columns, such as created_at and updated_at.
