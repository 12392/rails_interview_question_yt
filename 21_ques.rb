# How many types of associations are in rails?

# There are several types of associations in Rails:

# Belongs_to association: 
# This association defines a one-to-one or one-to-many relationship where the foreign key resides in the associated table.

# Has_one association: 
# This association defines a one-to-one relationship where the foreign key resides in the associated table.

# Has_many association:
#  This association defines a one-to-many relationship where the foreign key resides in the associated table.

# Has_many :through association: 
# This association defines a many-to-many relationship through a join table.

# Has_one :through association: 
# This association defines a one-to-one relationship through a join table.

# Has_and_belongs_to_many association: 
# This association defines a many-to-many relationship without the need for a join model.

# All of these association types are used to define relationships between different ActiveRecord models in Rails. 
# They allow you to specify how the different models are related to each other, 
# and provide a convenient way to access and manipulate the associated data.
