# I can provide you with a summary of some significant features and changes in several Rails versions up until my knowledge cutoff date 
# in January 2022. Keep in mind that there may be more recent versions or updates beyond this date.

# ### Rails 7(2021)
# 1. Webpack and Node are not required.
# For example- to install date-fns:
# $ ./bin/importmap pin date-fns

# 2. Rails 7 will automatically encrypt and decrypt your application and its database.
# But, the catch is that you cannot query the database of the field unless you use the encrypts method to 
# pass the deterministic: true option

# 3 Developers can now use the load_async method while querying data to fetch results. 
# This is time-savvy when asking multiple queries together. Using this, you can run-

# def PostsController
#     def index
#     @posts = Post.load_async
#     @categories = Category.load_async
#     end
# end

# 4 UJS and Turbolinks is now replaced Stimulus and Turbo


# ### Rails 6 (2019):
# 1. **Action Mailbox:** Introduced to handle incoming emails and integrate them into the application.
# 2. **Action Text:** Integrated rich text content with Active Storage for handling images and other attachments.
# 3. **Parallel Testing:** Added support for running tests in parallel, improving testing performance.

# ### Rails 5.2 (2018):

# 2. **Redis Cache Store:** Added support for Redis as a cache store.

# ### Rails 5.1 (2017):

# 2. **JavaScript Integration:** Improved JavaScript integration with Yarn and Webpack.
# 3. **Encrypted Secrets:** Enhanced security for managing secrets in development and production.

# ### Rails 5.0 (2016):
# 1. **Action Cable:** Introduced real-time features with WebSockets.
# 2. **API Mode:** Streamlined the development of API-only applications.
# 3. **TurboLinks 5:** Improved the performance of navigating between pages without full page reloads.

# ### Rails 4.2 (2014):
# 1. **Active Job:** Standardized the handling of background jobs.
# 2. **GlobalID:** Provided a framework for representing objects with global identifiers.

# it's recommended to check the official Rails release notes on the [Ruby on Rails GitHub repository](https://github.com/rails/rails/releases).
