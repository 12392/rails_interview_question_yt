# What is the find each method in Rails? Also explain why the .all method is not ideal to use for loading all the instances of a model at once?


# In Ruby on Rails, the find_each method is a part of ActiveRecord, which is the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) 
# layer used to interact with databases. The find_each method is specifically designed for efficiently retrieving 
# and processing a large number of records from a database.

# find_each Method:
# The find_each method is used to iterate over a large set of records in batches, instead of loading all records into memory at once. 
# It is particularly useful when dealing with a large dataset to avoid memory issues and improve performance. 
# The method takes an optional batch_size parameter, which specifies the number of records to retrieve in each batch.

# Here's an example of how find_each might be used:
Book.find_each(batch_size: 100) do |book|
    # Process each book record
    puts "Processing book: #{book.title}"
end
  

# In this example, books are retrieved in batches of 100, and the provided block is executed for each batch.

# Why Not Use .all for Loading All Instances?
# While the .all method is available in ActiveRecord to retrieve all instances of a model, 
# it can be inefficient when dealing with a large dataset. When you use .all, ActiveRecord loads all records into memory at once, 
# which can lead to performance issues and increased memory consumption.

# For example:
# Loading all instances into memory
# all_books = Book.all

# If the dataset is substantial, loading all records at once may result in increased response times, 
# potential memory exhaustion, and degraded application performance.

# On the other hand, find_each efficiently processes records in batches, making it more suitable for 
# scenarios where a large number of records need to be retrieved without overloading memory.

# In summary, while .all is convenient for small datasets, find_each is a better choice when dealing with a 
# large number of records to optimize memory usage and maintain performance. The use of find_each is a good practice 
# when working with large datasets to avoid unnecessary resource consumption.
