# Why does ruby not support method overloading?

# Ruby does not support traditional method overloading as seen in some other programming languages like Java or C++. 
# Method overloading allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists, 
# and the appropriate method is chosen based on the number or types of arguments provided during the method invocation.

# There are several reasons why Ruby does not have method overloading in the traditional sense:

# Dynamic Typing:
# Ruby is a dynamically-typed language, which means the types of variables are determined at runtime. 
# Unlike statically-typed languages where method signatures must specify the types of parameters, 
# Ruby methods can accept arguments of any type. This dynamic typing makes it challenging to determine which version of a method 
# to call based solely on the parameter types.

# Flexibility and Expressiveness:
# Ruby values expressiveness and flexibility. The ability to define methods with varying numbers of arguments or 
# to use default values for parameters provides a more flexible and concise way of defining methods. This flexibility aligns 
# with Ruby's philosophy of allowing developers to express their intentions in a clear and natural manner.

# Default Parameter Values:
# Ruby allows developers to define default values for method parameters. This eliminates the need 
# for multiple method signatures with different numbers of parameters. If a parameter is not provided during the method call, 
# the default value is used.

def example_method(arg1, arg2 = "default_value")
  # Method logic
end

# Variable-Length Argument Lists:
# Ruby supports variable-length argument lists through the use of the splat operator (*). 
# This allows methods to accept any number of arguments, further reducing the need for method overloading.
def variable_args(*args)
  # Method logic
end

# Method Signature Clarity:
# In Ruby, the emphasis is on clear and readable code. Allowing multiple method signatures with different parameter lists 
# might lead to ambiguity and make it less clear which version of a method is being called.
# While traditional method overloading is not supported, Ruby developers have alternative ways to achieve similar results 
# using default parameter values, variable-length argument lists, and other dynamic language features. 
# This approach aligns with Ruby's philosophy of providing developers with expressive and flexible tools to write clean and concise code.
