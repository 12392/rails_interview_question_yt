# What is ActionCable? Explain.

# ActionCable is a feature introduced in Rails 5 that allows you to build real-time applications using WebSockets. It provides a framework for building web applications that need to push data to the client in real-time, 
#  as chat applications, social media feeds, and online gaming platforms.

# With ActionCable, you can create channels for communication between the server and the client,
#  and you can broadcast messages to these channels to update the client's view in real-time. 
#  ActionCable is built on top of the WebSocket protocol, which allows bi-directional communication between the client and the server.

# ActionCable provides a set of APIs that allow you to easily implement real-time features 
# in your Rails application. These APIs include:

# Channel: A channel represents a logical unit of work in your application that involves real-time communication with the client. 
#  can define channels for different tasks, such as chat messages, notifications, or updates to a live feed.

# Action: An action is a method defined in a channel that is invoked when a message is received from the client.
#  You can define actions for different types of messages, such as creating a new message, updating an existing message, or deleting a message.

# Subscription: A subscription is a connection between the client and the server that allows the server to push updates 
# to the client in real-time. You can define subscriptions for different types of channels, such as chat channels or feed channels.

# Broadcasting: Broadcasting is the process of sending a message to all the clients subscribed to a particular channel. 
# You can broadcast messages to update the client's view in real-time, such as when a new message is posted in a chat channel.

# ActionCable also includes support for advanced features such as authorization, callbacks, and testing. With ActionCable, 
# you can easily build real-time applications that provide a smooth and seamless user experience.
