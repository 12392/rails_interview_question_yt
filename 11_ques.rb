# What is the difference Tree between includes and joins?


# In Rails, includes and joins are used to retrieve associated records from the database. 
# However, there are some important differences between the two methods.

# includes is used for eager loading associations, 
# meaning that it retrieves all the necessary associated records in a single query. 
# This can help prevent N+1 queries and improve the performance of your application. 
# When you use includes, Rails will execute two queries: one to retrieve the main records 
# and one to retrieve the associated records.

# On the other hand, joins is used to join two or more tables together and retrieve data from them in a single query. 
# joins can be used to retrieve data from multiple tables and to perform more complex queries than includes. 
# However, joins does not automatically retrieve associated records like includes does. 
# Instead, you have to specify the columns you want to retrieve from the associated table(s) in your query.

# Here's an example to illustrate the difference between includes and joins:

# Includes
@posts = Post.includes(:author)
@posts.each do |post|
  puts post.author.name
end

# Joins
@posts = Post.joins(:author).select('posts.*, authors.name')
@posts.each do |post|
  puts post.name + ' by ' + post.author.name
end



# In this code, the first example uses includes to eager load the author association for each post.
# The second example uses joins to join the posts and authors tables and retrieve the post name and author name in a single query.

# Overall, includes is used for eager loading associated records, 
# while joins is used for joining tables together and retrieving data from them in a single query
