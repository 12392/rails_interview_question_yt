# What do you mean by session hijacking?

# Session hijacking, also known as session stealing or session sniffing, is a security attack where an unauthorized person intercepts 
# or takes over an active session between a user and a computer system. In this type of attack, the attacker gains access to the user's 
# session information, allowing them to impersonate the user and potentially perform actions on their behalf.

# Here's a simplified explanation of how session hijacking typically occurs:

# Session Creation:
# When a user logs into a web application, a session is established between the user's browser and the server. The server generates a unique session identifier (session ID) for the user, which is often stored as a cookie on the user's browser.

# Session Identifier:
# The session ID is used to associate the user's requests with their session on the server. 
# It is sent with each subsequent request to identify the user and maintain the session state.

# Interception of Session ID:
# During a session hijacking attack, an attacker intercepts the session ID. 
# This interception can occur through various means, such as sniffing unencrypted network traffic, 
# exploiting vulnerabilities in the application, or using malicious software.

# Impersonation:
# With the stolen session ID, the attacker can impersonate the legitimate user. They can inject the stolen session ID into their own requests, 
# making the server think that the requests are coming from the legitimate user.

# Unauthorized Access:
# Once the attacker has successfully hijacked the session, they may gain unauthorized access to the user's account,
# perform actions on behalf of the user, or extract sensitive information
