# What do you mean by content_for in Rails?

# In Rails, `content_for` is a method provided by the Rails view system to capture and store content within named content blocks. 
# It's commonly used in layouts to allow views to insert content into specific sections of the layout.

# Here's how `content_for` works:

# 1. **In the Layout:**
#    - In the layout file (usually `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb`), you define named content blocks using the `yield` method.

   ```erb
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
     <title>My Rails App</title>
     <%= yield :head %>
   </head>
   <body>
     <%= yield %>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

#    In this example, there is a named content block `:head` in the `<head>` section.

# 2. **In the View:**
#    - In the view files, you use the `content_for` method to fill the named content blocks.

   ```erb
   <% content_for :head do %>
     <meta charset="utf-8">
     <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
   <% end %>

   <h1>Welcome to My App</h1>
   <p>This is the home page content.</p>
   ```

#    The content inside the `content_for` block is captured and stored to be rendered in the corresponding `yield` section in the layout.

# 3. **Result:**
#    - When the view is rendered, the content specified in the `content_for` blocks is inserted into the layout at the corresponding 
#    `yield` locations.

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
     <title>My Rails App</title>
     <meta charset="utf-8">
     <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
   </head>
   <body>
     <h1>Welcome to My App</h1>
     <p>This is the home page content.</p>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

# This mechanism allows views to inject content into specific sections of a layout dynamically. 
# It's particularly useful for scenarios where different views might need to customize certain parts of a shared 
# layout without duplicating the entire layout structure. `content_for` provides a clean way to modularize layouts 
# and views in Rails applications.
