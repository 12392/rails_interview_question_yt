# What is the difference between deliver now and deliver later methods for sending emails?

# In Rails, the deliver_now and deliver_later methods are used for sending emails, but they differ in how they handle the delivery of the 
# email message.

# deliver_now Method:

# Synchronous Delivery:
# deliver_now is a synchronous method, meaning it sends the email immediately in the current thread of execution.

# Blocking:
# When deliver_now is called, the application waits for the email to be sent, and the response is returned only after the 
# email has been successfully delivered or if an error occurs during delivery.

# Usage:
# Typically used when you want the email to be sent immediately and the sending of the email is an integral part of the current 
# request-response cycle.

# Example:
UserMailer.welcome_email(user).deliver_now

# deliver_later Method:

# Asynchronous Delivery:
# deliver_later is an asynchronous method, meaning it queues the email to be sent in the background without blocking the current thread.

# Background Job Queue:
# It relies on a background job processing system (such as Active Job with an appropriate queue adapter, Sidekiq, Resque, etc.) 
# to handle the actual sending of the email in a separate process.

# Non-Blocking:
# The application doesn't wait for the email to be sent, and the response is returned immediately after queuing the job.

# Usage:
# Used when you want to offload the email sending process to a background job to improve application responsiveness and scalability.

# Example:
UserMailer.welcome_email(user).deliver_later

# Considerations:

# Performance:
# deliver_later is generally preferred for performance reasons, especially when email sending might take some time or 
# if it involves external services. It helps keep the response time of your web application fast.

# Error Handling:
# deliver_now provides immediate feedback and raises an exception if there is an issue during the delivery process. 
# On the other hand, deliver_later performs error handling within the background job, and any errors won't i
# mpact the current request-response cycle.

# Background Job System:
# For deliver_later to work, you need to have a configured background job system. 
# Ensure that your application's setup includes an appropriate job queue system.

# Configuration:
# Depending on your application's configuration and requirements, you might choose one method over the other. 
# For example, you may prefer deliver_now for critical notifications that should be sent immediately.

# Summary:
# Use deliver_now when you want the email to be sent immediately and don't mind blocking the current thread.
# Use deliver_later when you want to send the email asynchronously in the background to improve application responsiveness and scalability.
