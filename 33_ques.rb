# What are turbolinks into rails?

# Turbolinks is a gem for Ruby on Rails that helps speed up page loading times by replacing 
# full page reloads with JavaScript-based partial updates. It works by intercepting links and form submissions on a web page, 
# and instead of loading a new page, it fetches only the HTML for the new page and updates the current page's body with the new content.

# Turbolinks uses the window.history.pushState() method to manipulate the browser's history and replace the current page 
# with the new content. This means that users can navigate between pages on your website without experiencing the full page reloads 
# that would normally be required.

# By using Turbolinks, you can improve the perceived speed of your Rails application by reducing the amount of time
#  that users have to wait for pages to load. Since only the content that has changed is loaded, the overall amount of data transferred 
#  is reduced, which can also help improve performance on slower network connections.

# To use Turbolinks in a Rails application, you can add the turbolinks gem to your Gemfile and include it in your application.js file
#  using the require directive. Once it is included, Turbolinks will automatically intercept links and form submissions on your web pages 
#  and replace full page reloads with partial updates.

# However, it is important to note that Turbolinks may not work well with certain JavaScript libraries or plugins that rely on f
# ull page reloads or that manipulate the browser's history directly. 
# Additionally, since Turbolinks relies on JavaScript to update the page content, 
# it may not be suitable for websites or applications that require full page refreshes or that rely on server-side rendering.
