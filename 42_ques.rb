# You are asked to implement an admin backend for a web application. What solution will you propose? Any gem or custom admin panel? Also explain the reason.



# If you need a quick and easy-to-use solution for building an admin backend, 
# using a gem such as ActiveAdmin or RailsAdmin might be a good choice. These gems provide a lot of features out of the box, 
# including CRUD operations, filtering and searching, nested models, and more.

# However, if you need more customization options or want to have more control over the look and feel of your admin panel, 
# a custom admin panel might be a better option. You can build a custom admin panel using the same tools and techniques 
# you use to build the rest of your Rails application. This approach can be more time-consuming than using a gem, 
# but it can give you more control over the final result.

# When deciding between a gem or a custom solution, it's important to consider factors such as your budget, timeline, 
# development resources, and project requirements. If you have limited time and budget, using a gem might be the most practical choice.
#  If you have more resources and flexibility, building a custom admin panel can give you more control and flexibility over the final result.

# In summary, the decision between using a gem or a custom admin panel ultimately depends on your project requirements and preferences. 
# Both solutions have their pros and cons, and it's important to carefully evaluate your options before making a decision.
