# What is the difference between class methods and scopes? Are they similar?


# Class methods and scopes are both ways to define methods on a model in Ruby on Rails, but they serve different purposes.

# Class methods are methods that are defined on the model class itself, 
# rather than on instances of the class. They are typically used for behavior that is related to the class as a whole, 
# rather than to individual instances of the class. 
# For example, you might define a class method on a User model to generate a random password like this:

class User < ApplicationRecord
    def self.generate_random_password
      # Generate a random password
    end
end

# You would call this method on the class itself, like this:
password = User.generate_random_password


# Scopes, on the other hand, are methods that return a relation object that can be further chained or modified. 
# They are used to define common queries that can be reused throughout your application. 
# For example, you might define a scope on a Post model to return all published posts like this:

class Post < ApplicationRecord
    scope :published, -> { where(published: true) }
end


# You would call this scope like this:

published_posts = Post.published


# The key difference between class methods and scopes is that class methods are defined on the class itself and return any arbitrary value, 
# while scopes return a relation object that can be further chained or modified to build up a more complex query.

# In general, you would use class methods for behavior that is related to the class as a whole, 
# and scopes for defining common queries that can be reused throughout your application. 
# However, there is some overlap between the two, and you can use them in combination to achieve more complex behavior if needed.
