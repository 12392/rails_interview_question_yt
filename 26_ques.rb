# What do you mean by concerns in Rails? 
# Explain the way of using a concern.


# In Ruby on Rails, a concern is a module that encapsulates a set of functionalities
# that can be included into one or more Ruby classes. 
# Concerns are a way to extract reusable code from a class and avoid duplicating code across multiple classes.

# To use a concern in Rails, you can define a module in the app/controllers/concerns or app/models/concerns directory, 
# depending on whether the concern is intended for use in controllers or models. 
# For example, if you want to define a concern for authentication, you could create a module like this:

# app/controllers/concerns/authentication.rb
module Authentication
    extend ActiveSupport::Concern
  
    included do
      before_action :authenticate_user!
    end
  
    def authenticate_user!
      # Your authentication code here
    end
  end
 
  
# In this example, the Authentication module defines a before_action filter that calls the authenticate_user! 
# method before every action in the controller that includes the concern. The included block is used to define the filter.

# To include the concern in a controller or model, you can use the include method and 
# pass in the name of the module as a symbol. For example:

# app/controllers/posts_controller.rb
class PostsController < ApplicationController
    include Authentication
    
    # Your controller code here
  end
 
  
#   In this example, the PostsController includes the Authentication concern, 
#   so every action in the controller will first call the authenticate_user! method defined in the concern.

# Using concerns in Rails can help keep your code organized and reduce duplication.
# By extracting common functionality into concerns, you can make your code more modular and easier to maintain over time.
