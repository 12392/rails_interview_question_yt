# What do you mean by partials in Rails? Explain the usage of partials and the way we can pass local variables to a partial.

# Partials in Rails are a way to break down views into smaller, reusable pieces of code.
#  A partial is essentially a sub-view that can be included in one or more other views. 
#  This can help to reduce code duplication and make views easier to manage.

# To create a partial in Rails, you can create a new file in the app/views directory with a name that begins with an underscore (e.g. _partial.html.erb). 
# You can then include the partial in another view by using the render method and passing 
# in the name of the partial as a symbol or string (e.g. <%= render partial: 'partial' %>).

# Partials can also accept local variables, which are variables that are passed in from the parent view. 
# This allows you to customize the behavior of the partial based on the context in which it is being used. 
# To pass a local variable to a partial, 
# you can use the locals option when calling the render method (e.g. <%= render partial: 'partial', locals: { variable: value } %>).

# Inside the partial, you can access the local variables 
# using the same name as the key in the locals hash (e.g. <%= variable %>). 
# You can also use any of the standard Rails view helpers and methods inside a partial, just as you would in a regular view.

# Using partials in Rails can make your views more modular and easier to maintain, 
# and can help to reduce code duplication. They can also be used to implement common UI components, 
# such as navigation bars or footers, that are used across multiple pages in your application.
