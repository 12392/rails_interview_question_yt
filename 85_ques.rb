# What is the difference between :allow nil and :allow blank validation options?

# In the context of Rails validations, :allow_nil and :allow_blank are options that can be used with certain validation methods. 
# These options control whether a validation should be considered successful when the attribute being validated is nil or empty.

# 1. :allow_nil:

# Usage:
# :allow_nil is an option that can be applied to most validation methods.
# When specified, it allows the attribute to be nil without triggering a validation error.

# Example:
class User < ApplicationRecord
  validates :name, presence: true, allow_nil: true
end

# In this example, the :allow_nil option is applied to the presence validation for the name attribute. 
# It means that a nil value for name will not trigger a validation error.

# 2. :allow_blank:

# Usage:
# :allow_blank is an option specific to the presence validation method.
# When specified, it allows the attribute to be an empty string ("") without triggering a validation error.

# Example:
class User < ApplicationRecord
  validates :email, presence: true, allow_blank: true
end

# In this example, the :allow_blank option is applied to the presence validation for the email attribute. 
# It means that an empty string for email will not trigger a validation error.

# Differences:

# Type of Value Allowed:
# :allow_nil: Allows the attribute to be nil.
# :allow_blank: Allows the attribute to be an empty string ("").

# Applicable Validation Methods:
# :allow_nil: Can be used with various validation methods, not limited to presence.
# :allow_blank: Specifically used with the presence validation method.

# Use Cases:
# :allow_nil: Useful when you want to allow nil values regardless of the validation method.
# :allow_blank: Specifically useful with presence validation when you want to allow empty strings.

# Example:
class Book < ApplicationRecord
  validates :title, presence: true, allow_blank: true
  validates :author, presence: true, allow_nil: true
end

# In this example:
# The title attribute is required (presence), but an empty string is allowed.
# The author attribute is required (presence), but nil is allowed.

# Recommendations:
# Use :allow_nil when you want to allow nil values for an attribute regardless of the validation method.
# Use :allow_blank when you specifically want to allow empty strings for an attribute with the presence validation.
# Choose the option that aligns with your specific requirements for handling nil or empty values in your model's attributes.
