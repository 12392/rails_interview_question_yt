# What do you mean by a rails engine? Explain when we need to use a rails engine? Also if you know, list a few gems which are engines as well.
    
# In Ruby on Rails, a Rails engine is a self-contained and modular Rails application that can be integrated into a larger Rails application. 
# An engine encapsulates a set of functionalities, including controllers, models, views, assets, and routes, and 
# it operates within the context of a host application.

# Key Characteristics of a Rails Engine:
# Modularity:
# Engines provide a way to package and modularize functionality, making it easy to share and reuse across different Rails applications.

# Isolation:
# Engines operate within their own namespace, preventing naming conflicts with the host application. 
# This isolation allows for encapsulation of logic and minimizes interference with the host application's code.

# Mounting:
# Engines are mounted in the host application's config/routes.rb file. Once mounted, their routes become part of the host application's routing system.

# Asset Pipeline:
# Engines can have their own asset pipeline, including stylesheets, JavaScript files, and images. This allows for easy management of assets specific to the engine.

# Views and Partials:
# Engines can provide their own views and partials, contributing to the host application's user interface.

# Database Migrations:
# Engines can include database migrations, making it possible to extend the host application's database schema.

# Use Cases for Rails Engines:
# Reusable Components:
# When a set of functionalities is common across multiple applications, packaging them as an engine allows for easy reuse.

# Isolated Subsystems:
# For isolating subsystems within a larger application, such as a forum, blog, or authentication system.

# Plugin Replacement:
# As a more modern and modular replacement for traditional plugins.

# Decomposition of Monoliths:
# When decomposing a monolithic Rails application into smaller, manageable parts.

# Examples of Gems that Are Rails Engines:

# Devise:
# A flexible authentication solution for Rails. It provides a set of controllers, views, and models for handling user authentication.

gem 'devise'

# Spree Commerce:
# An open-source e-commerce platform for Rails. Spree is implemented as a Rails engine and can be mounted in a Rails application 
# to add e-commerce functionality.

gem 'spree'

# Forem:
# A Rails engine for adding forum functionality to a Rails application. It includes controllers, views, and models for managing forum discussions.
gem 'forem'

# ActsAsTaggableOn:
# A gem for adding tagging functionality to Rails models. It operates as a Rails engine and provides controllers and models for managing tags.
gem 'acts-as-taggable-on'

# Solidus:
# Another open-source e-commerce platform for Rails. Solidus is implemented as a Rails engine and can be integrated into a Rails application to enable e-commerce features.

gem 'solidus'

# When to Use a Rails Engine:

# Use a Rails engine when you want to package and share a modular set of functionalities across multiple Rails applications.
# Use engines for isolating subsystems, providing reusable components, or when you need to decompose a monolithic Rails application.
# Consider engines when you want to create a standalone, mountable component with its own controllers, models, views, and routes.

# Rails engines are a powerful tool for creating modular and reusable components within the Rails ecosystem, 
# allowing developers to share and distribute functionalities seamlessly.
