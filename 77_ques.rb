# What is the difference between a gem and Rails engine?

# Both gems and Rails engines are mechanisms in the Ruby on Rails ecosystem for organizing and packaging code in a modular 
# and reusable way, but they serve different purposes and have some key differences.

# Gem:

# Purpose:
# A gem is a self-contained package of Ruby code that can include libraries, utilities, and even entire applications.
# Gems are not specific to Rails and can be used in any Ruby project.

# Packaging:
# Gems are packaged and distributed via the RubyGems platform, which allows developers to share and consume libraries easily.

# Scope:
# Gems can cover a wide range of functionalities, from utility libraries to full-fledged applications.
# They are not limited to web development or Rails-specific functionality.

# Usage:
# Gems are included in a Ruby project's Gemfile, and their functionality can be accessed throughout the project.

# Rails Engine:

# Purpose:
# A Rails engine is a mini Rails application that can be embedded within a larger Rails application.
# It allows developers to modularize and encapsulate functionality that can be shared across multiple Rails applications.

# Packaging:
# While a gem can be a standalone package, a Rails engine is usually packaged and used within the context of a larger Rails application.

# Scope:
# Rails engines are specifically designed for web development within the Rails framework.
# They can include controllers, models, views, assets, and routes, making them suitable for extending the functionality of a Rails application.

# Usage:
# A Rails engine is typically mounted in the host application's config/routes.rb file, and its components 
# become seamlessly integrated with the host application.

# Key Differences:

# Scope and Purpose:

# Gems are general-purpose packages that can be used in any Ruby project, whereas Rails engines are tailored for use within the Rails framework.

# Packaging and Distribution:
# Gems are packaged and distributed independently via RubyGems.
# Rails engines are often developed and distributed as part of a larger Rails application, and they may not be 
# independently packaged as standalone gems.

# Mounting:
# Gems are included in a project's Gemfile, and their functionality is accessed throughout the project.
# Rails engines are explicitly mounted in the host application, and their routes and functionality become part of the host application.

# Rails-Specific Functionality:
# Rails engines are designed to provide Rails-specific functionality, such as controllers, views, models, and routes, 

# while gems can cover a broader spectrum of functionalities.

# Example:
# Consider a gem providing utility functions and a Rails engine providing a set of controllers, views, and assets for managing blog posts:

# Gem:
# Provides utility methods for working with strings, dates, etc.

# Can be used in any Ruby project.

# Included in the Gemfile:

# gem 'utility_gem'

# Rails Engine:
# Provides controllers, views, and assets for managing blog posts.
# Specific to the Rails framework.
# Mounted in the host application's config/routes.rb:

# config/routes.rb
# mount BlogEngine::Engine => '/blog'

# In summary, while gems are versatile and can be used across various Ruby projects, Rails engines are specifically 
# designed to extend the functionality of Rails applications, providing a modular and encapsulated way to structure 
# and share code within the Rails ecosystem.
