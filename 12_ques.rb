# What do you mean by self_join association in Rails?

# A self-join association in Rails is a type of association where a model is associated with itself. 
# This can be useful in situations where you have a hierarchy or a relationship between records in the same table.

# For example, let's say you have a Category model that represents a category of products, 
# and each category can have a parent category. To represent this relationship in Rails, 
# you could define a self-join association on the Category model like this:

class Category < ApplicationRecord
    has_many :subcategories, class_name: "Category", foreign_key: "parent_id"
    belongs_to :parent_category, class_name: "Category", optional: true
end
  


# In this code, we define a has_many association called subcategories and a belongs_to association called parent_category, 
# both of which point to the same Category model. The has_many association specifies that a category can have many subcategories, 
# and the belongs_to association specifies that a category can belong to a parent category. 
# We use the class_name option to specify the name of the associated class (in this case, Category), 
# and we use the foreign_key option to specify the foreign key that points to the parent category. 
# We also set the optional option to true to allow for categories that don't have a parent category.

# With this self-join association defined, we can now retrieve a category's subcategories or parent category 
# using the subcategories or parent_category methods, respectively:

category = Category.find(1)
subcategories = category.subcategories
parent_category = category.parent_category


# In this code, we retrieve a category with an ID of 1 and then use the subcategories 
# and parent_category methods to retrieve its associated subcategories and parent category, respectively.

# Overall, self-join associations can be a powerful tool 
# for representing hierarchical or self-referential relationships between records in the same table.
