# What is the difference between ActiveModel and ActiveRecord in rails?

# In Ruby on Rails, ActiveModel and ActiveRecord are two related but distinct components that play different roles in the framework.

# ActiveModel:
# Purpose: ActiveModel is a module in Rails that provides a standard interface for any Ruby object to 
# interact with Action Pack (part of the Rails framework responsible for handling web requests and responses) 
# and Action View (responsible for rendering views). It allows non-database-backed objects to behave like ActiveRecord models, 
# enabling them to work seamlessly with forms, validations, and other features provided by ActionController and ActionView.

# Features: ActiveModel includes modules such as Validations for adding validation behavior, Conversion for 
# converting objects to different formats, and Translation for handling internationalization. 
# By including ActiveModel::Model in a class, that class gains the behavior of an Active Model, making it compatible with Rails forms 
# and other conventions.

# Example:
class Person
  include ActiveModel::Model

  attr_accessor :name, :email

  validates_presence_of :name
end


# ActiveRecord:
# Purpose: ActiveRecord is a key component of Rails that provides an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) layer. 
# It facilitates the interaction between Ruby objects and a relational database. ActiveRecord allows you to represent database tables as 
# Ruby classes, and instances of those classes correspond to rows in the database. It provides a set of conventions 
# for mapping between the database and the object-oriented world, making it easier to perform database operations using Ruby syntax.

# Features: ActiveRecord provides features like associations (defining relationships between models), validations (ensuring data integrity), 
# callbacks (executing code at certain points in the lifecycle of an object), and query interface for performing database queries.

Example:

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates_presence_of :name, :email
end

# In summary, ActiveModel is a module that provides a set of conventions for any Ruby object to behave like a model in a Rails application, 
# while ActiveRecord is a component of Rails specifically designed for database interaction, providing an ORM layer to work with relational databases. 
# ActiveModel is more about abstracting common behaviors for any Ruby object, while ActiveRecord focuses on the interaction with relational databases. 
# Often, ActiveRecord models include ActiveModel functionality, making them compatible with both database-backed and non-database-backed scenarios.
